          <h4> Scuba Diving</h4>
          <p>I have been scuba certified since the summer of 2014. I have scuba diving in Hawaii, Cayman Islands, Curaçao, and Mexico. The coolest thing I have seen while diving is either a seahorse or tons a turtles. I love diving with my family, you can
            see a whole different world below the water. </p>

          <h4>Taking things apart</h4>
          <p> I have taken apart mostly electronics. Watches, a speaker, and a 2005 desktop monitor are a few of the items I have taken fully apart. I like taking things apart and figuring out how everything works together. I always take apart things that
            do not work properly, that way I do not have to worry about putting the item back together.

            <h4>Skiing</h4>
            <p> I have been skiing twice in Colorado. I am confident one greens and am growing to like blue routes. I have done a few black routes but not that many. I do not fully know how to do mougles. I think the next time I go skiing with my family,
              I should try learning how.

            <h4>Biking</h4>
            <p> I love biking with my cousins and family. I like riding on trials the best because when you get to the top of a really tall hill, you get a nice view of below; plus it is more challenging.
