          Hello, my name is Katherine Sandys, and I live in Noblesville, Indiana. My Family includes my Mom, Dad, and sister Lauren. I am currently a High School senior. When I am not in school and have free time, I do enjoy traveling and being active.

        <h3> Scuba Diving</h3>
        <p>I have been scuba certified since the summer of 2014. I have been scuba diving in Hawaii, Cayman Islands, Curaçao, and Mexico. The coolest thing I have seen while diving is either a seahorse or a bunch of turtles. I love diving with my family; you can see a whole different world below the water. </p>

        <h3>Running</h3>
        <p>I have been running since 5th grade. My 3k time is around 11:50 and my 5k time is 19:41. I have done two 6 mile races with my sister. On May 18, I will be running my first half marathon. I am excited to see how I will do at a longer distance race. </p>

        <h3>Taking things apart</h3>
        <p>I have taken apart mostly electronics; watches, a speaker, and a 2005 desktop monitor are a few of the items I have taken entirely apart. I like taking things apart and figuring out how everything works together. I always take apart things that do not work correctly, that way I do not have to worry about putting the item back together.</p>

        <h3>Skiing</h3>
        <p>I have been skiing twice in Colorado. I am confident on greens and am growing to like blue routes. I have done a few black routes but not that many. I do not fully know how to do moguls. I think the next time I go skiing with my family; I should try learning how. </p>

        <h3>Biking</h3>
        <p>I love biking with my cousins and family. I like riding on trials the best because when you get to the top of a tall hill, you get a beautiful view of below; plus it is more challenging. </p>
