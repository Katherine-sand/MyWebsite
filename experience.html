    <h2>My Experiences</h2>
    <p>My senior year of High School, 2018-2019, I had an internship at BlueSky Technology Partners. I spent roughly 3 hours every other school day there, doing projects that were assigned to me. They ranged form web development to small marketing tasks.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I participated in Girls Go Cyber Start in the Spring of 2019. I was working with as part of a team of 4 solving all sorts of problems. I enjoyed working as a team with other girls solving problems. I participated under the team name Noblesville High School. I placed 7th overall, and I had fun during the competition. Here is more <a href="https://medium.com/girls-go-cyberstart/girls-go-cyberstarts-fantastic-results-for-2019-bb404262f4ca">details</a> on the results for 2019. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Over the summer of 2017, I participated in Girls Who Code in Austin, Texas, and I was with 20 other girls. The program lasted two months, and I gained a passion for coding during that time.</p>
