    <p>Over the summer of 2017, I participated in Girls Who Code in Austin, Texas, and I was with 20 other girls. The program lasted two months, and I gained a passion for coding during that time.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This school year, 2018-2019, I have had an internship at BlueSky Technology Partners. I spend roughly 3 hours every other school day there, doing projects that are assigned to me.</p>
